# Logic-Coders-Hackathon
<br>
Our website mainly focuses on digitalizing health process, Our website gives users an option for sending their health issues through patient's login and then doctor's with their seperate doctor's login can see all the queries of patient's and the doctor's can reply to the patient through our portal and the messgae will be sent to the respective patient by this online communication is established, with quick replies and fully secured way. This website is also highly user friendly in terms of UI/UX and backend services.

To Build and Run this project we first need to install xampp software which will compile php codes
<br>
Then we need to have use phpMyAdmin MySQL as our database which we use to store and extract the data.
<br>
We have also installed PHPMailer for sending email of description of disease and medicines suggested by doctor online.
<br>
To run in browser (suggested:Chrome) just write localhost/path_of_file/file_name.php and it will compile the php code
<br>
For both Windows and MacOS the procedure is exactly same for installation and running of our project.

Thank You!
