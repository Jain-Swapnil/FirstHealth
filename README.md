<br>
To Build and Run this project we first need to install xampp software which will compile php codes
<br>
Then we need to have use phpMyAdmin MySQL as our database which we use to store and extract the data.
<br>
We have also installed PHPMailer for sending email of description of disease and medicines suggested by doctor online.
<br>
To run in browser (suggested:Chrome) just write localhost/path_of_file/file_name.php and it will compile the php code
<br>
For both Windows and MacOS the procedure is exactly same for installation and running of our project.
<br>
Thank You!
